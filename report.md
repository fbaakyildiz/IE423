**Introduction** 
In dynamic sports like soccer, game statistic metrics, such as ball possession, attacking plays, or successful passes, play an essential role in making match predictions. Events like penalties, red cards, yellow cards, and goals may cause alterations in these metrics. These events can also change the outcome of the match. In this project, the metric to be analyzed has been chosen as ball possession. After that, a hypothesis, which is given below, is constructed to see if the selected metric can be used to predict the match's result. Analysis in the project mainly focuses on the events such as the number of red cards, yellow cards, penalties issued and the number of goals events with respect to change in ball possession rates. Out of 102 unique soccer games, 6 interesting games are selected according to code constructed to choose the matches that includes the interesting events and potential out of control points or trends. The interesting games with the most events and ooc signals are chosen to detect the mean shifts on Shewhart Charts easily. 
We’ve developed a task-orianted yet simple algorithm basically iterates over all matches establish control limits, determine sample parameters, then identify the number of out-of-control signals and significant events in the match (such as red cards and goals). Subsequently, It sums these values to create an interesting score for each match. We picked 8 the most interesting matches using this algorithm.
